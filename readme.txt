Making it easy to use MDL components in WordPress via shortcodes

== Description ==
Material Design Lite (MDL) components are viewable at http://www.getmdl.io/components/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Work with my theme?
The styling of all these components is essentially self-contained. This plugin loads the styles, scripts, and font(s) needed and nothing more. Unless you have a theme that is based on MDL, these components will be styled as seen at http://www.getmdl.io/components/
